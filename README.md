# CV-1st-Project

This is just a basic website which I've made as a 1st learning project by using HTML primarily and a bit of CSS only while taking online course on Web Development. I know it's not pretty at all, but will definitely create something more creative and good looking responsive website along with learning some new stuff. Will upload some new projects later :)
